*** This file contains the results of a few runs of my program
*** in each run, the program generated 10 threads, each randomly chosen as a withdraw or deposit, and a random amount of money
*** due to the random nature of the program, I selected runs that help to show possible edge cases
*** to perform a run like this, simply run './hw5', or to build and run use 'make run'
